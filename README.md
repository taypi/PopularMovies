# Sandwich Club Project

## Project Overview

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, youâ€™ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. We will split the development of this app in two stages.

## Why this Project

To become an Android developer, you must know how to bring particular mobile experiences to life. Specifically, you need to know how to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, and optimize the experience for various mobile devices. You will hone these fundamental skills in this project.

## Goals

- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
- Allow your user to change sort order via a setting
- Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information

## The Movie DB API

To use this app you need to create an api key from [The Movie DBi](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
